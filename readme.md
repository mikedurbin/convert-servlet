# ConvertServlet

A simple servlet that is meant to serve as a fedora service which adds
a wrapper around images (generated by another fedora service) conveying
terms of use and bibliographic information.

To deploy this servlet:

1. Be sure that ImageMagick is installed and the "convert" command is on the path for the user under which the servlet container is running.
2. Update src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml to replace the context parameter values with those appropriate for your deployment environment
3. Invoke "mvn clean package"
4. Deploy "target/convert.war" in your favorite servlet container
